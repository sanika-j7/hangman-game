# Hangman Game
This is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time before running out of attempts. 
Each incorrect guess results in a part of a hangman being drawn. 
The player wins by guessing all the letters of the word before the hangman is fully drawn. 
The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
